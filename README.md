Playing with C++


To Compiile: g++ -g -o my_program my_program.cpp   

-g: option tells compiler to include debugging information in the generated executable.   
-o option specifies the name of the output file. In this case, the output (the compiled executable) will be named my_program. If you don't provide the -o option, g++ will, by default, produce an output file named a.out on Unix-like systems or a.exe on Windows.
